# rote

`rote` allows you to convert any pictures, or scanned documents to plain text files, and optionally convert them to high quality, production-grade epub (verifiable using [epubcheck](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck)) using Google Vision/Drive OCR backend.

In the current state, everything in the repo works as intended, however the code is a bit messy right now. When time allows, I will clean up, write documents, tests and publish a proper release.

PRs definitely help!
